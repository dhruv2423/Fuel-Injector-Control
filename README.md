# Fuel-Injector-Control
Fuel Injection is the introduction of fuel in an internal combustion engine, most commonly in automotive engines. Fuel injection plays a vital role in engine performance, even a slight change in the time when the fuel is injected, and the duration can make a significant change. Hence, fuel injection control should be very precise for optimal engine control. Here, we would be using following sensors to control the fuel injector and design a logic for temperature compensation to protect the engine at high temperature: 1. Hall Effect Sensor: It is a device that is used to measure the magnitude of a magnetic field. Its output voltage is directly proportional to the magnetic field strength through it. In engines, it measures the rpm based on which the injector parameters can be changed 2. Thermistor: It is a temperature sensor whose resistance changes with the change in temperature. There are 2 types, Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) and Positive Temperature Coefficient (PTC), wherein the resistance decreases with increase in temperature and increases with increase in temperature respectively. It is mainly used to measure the exhaust gas temperature. These sensors will be used to develop a control logic using Mototron wherein we will design a fuel injection control system using the engine rpm and thermistor readings.
